Do NOT trigger for creating or configuring an agent's own behaviour (system prompt, tools, knowledge) — that's agent creation/training, a separate domain."

# Agent Deployment

Deploying an agent means choosing where and how it runs: embedded in a page, floating site-wide, inside the editor, inside wp-admin, on a recurring schedule, or in response to a WordPress event. Every channel below writes to the same underlying storage the classic Publish (Deployment) admin screens use — a change made here shows up there, and vice versa.

## Available Tools

| Tool | When to use |
|---|---|
| `manage_agent_shortcode` | A chat widget the user pastes into one specific page, post, or text widget. |
| `manage_frontend_modal_agent` | A floating chat bubble shown to visitors across the whole site (or a subset of pages). |
| `manage_gutenberg_block_agent` | Makes an agent insertable as a block in the WordPress block editor / Site Editor. |
| `manage_editor_sidebar_agent` | An AI panel inside the block editor while writing posts/pages, with draft awareness. |
| `manage_admin_bar_launcher` | Chat access inside wp-admin: a per-agent admin-bar button, or the contextual "Ask AI" launcher on specific screens. |
| `manage_scheduled_task` | A recurring task an agent runs unattended (hourly/twice-daily/daily/weekly). |
| `manage_event_listener` | A trigger that runs an agent automatically when a WordPress action hook fires. |
| `agents_available` | Browse other agents the user could install if none of their active agents fit the request. |

## Workflows

### Embed a chat widget on one page

1. Confirm which agent and where it'll be pasted (page, post, or widget).
2. Call `manage_agent_shortcode` with `action: create`, the `agent_slug`, a `label`, and any style preferences (`style`, `height`, `placeholder`).
3. Hand back the exact shortcode string and tell the user to paste it into the page/post/widget content.

### Add a site-wide floating chat widget

1. Confirm which agent, which corner (`position`), and which pages (`pages`) — default to all pages unless the user says otherwise.
2. Call `manage_frontend_modal_agent` with `action: enable`.
3. Confirm it's live — no further action needed from the user, it applies immediately.

### Make an agent available as a block

Call `manage_gutenberg_block_agent` with `action: enable`. Tell the user to search for the agent by name in the block inserter next time they edit a post or page.

### Add an AI panel to the block editor

1. Confirm which agent(s) should appear, which post types (post/page/others), and whether draft content should be shared automatically (`inject_context`).
2. Call `manage_editor_sidebar_agent` with `action: update`, `enabled: true`, and the chosen `agent_slugs`/`post_types`.

### Add wp-admin chat access

- For a per-agent admin-bar button: `manage_admin_bar_launcher` with `target: agent_bar_button`, `agent_slug`, `enabled: true`, and optional `position`/`pages`.
- For the contextual "Ask AI" launcher shown on specific screens (Users, Plugins, etc.): `target: contextual_launcher`, `enabled: true`, `agent_slug`, and `screens`.

### Schedule a recurring task

1. State back the exact prompt the agent will follow and the recurrence (`hourly`/`twicedaily`/`daily`/`weekly`), and get explicit confirmation — this runs unattended, with nobody reviewing the outcome each time.
2. Call `manage_scheduled_task` with `action: create`, `agent_slug`, `prompt`, and `schedule`.
3. Confirm it's set up and mention where the user can review/cancel it later (the classic Scheduled Tasks tab, or by asking you to list/delete it).

### React automatically to a WordPress event

1. Identify the right hook for what the user described (e.g. `comment_post` for new comments, `user_register` for new sign-ups, `publish_post` for newly published posts, a WooCommerce order hook for order events).
2. State back the hook and the exact prompt the agent will follow, and get explicit confirmation — this also runs unattended.
3. Call `manage_event_listener` with `action: create`, `agent_slug`, `hook`, and `prompt`.

## Rules

- Always confirm before creating anything that runs unattended — scheduled tasks and event listeners. Everything else (widgets, blocks, editor sidebar, launchers) is reversible config, safe to just do and report back.
- If a deployment already exists for what's being asked, update it instead of creating a duplicate — list first when unsure.
- After any change, describe the result in plain language ("your Content Writer now appears as a chat bubble on every page"), not the underlying mechanics.
- If no active agent fits the request, use `agents_available` to suggest one rather than forcing a mismatched agent into the role.
